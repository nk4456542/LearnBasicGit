# LearnBasicGit
I built this repository to learn some basic git commands and to get started with github

This Repo includes 3 files :-
1. helloworld.py :- This file has some code which i used to understand how different branches have different code.
2. forloops.py :- This file too has some basic python code .
3. git commands.txt :- This file has some basic git commands that I learnt while building this repo.

So, using this repo I learnt some basic git commands and learnt how to host a repo on github.
